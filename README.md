# ☕ Coffee Stop

**Coffee Stop** is a simple Android app project built using **Jetpack Compose** and **Kotlin**, created as part of my learning journey through the [Android Development with Kotlin](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/android-kotlin/) course by [Maximiliano Firtman](https://frontendmasters.com/instructors/firtman/) on Frontend Masters.

This project demonstrates foundational Android development concepts, UI design with Compose, and basic app architecture — tailored for beginners or anyone looking to reinforce their Kotlin/Android skills.
